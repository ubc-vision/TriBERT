# TriBERT

This repository contains the code for the NeurIPS 2021 paper titled ["TriBERT: Full-body Human-centric Audio-visual Representation Learning for Visual Sound Separation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13412.pdf).

# Data pre-processing:

Please download [MUSIC21](https://github.com/roudimit/MUSIC_dataset). we found 314 videos are missing. Moreover, the train/val/test split was unavailable. Therefore, we used a random 80/20 train/test split which is given in [data](https://github.com/ubc-vision/TriBERT/tree/master/data).

# Pre-trained model

Please download our pre-trained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cOIEUzcp7tKO1C6OyXwso2Rrm0wZHuu2/view?usp=sharing).
